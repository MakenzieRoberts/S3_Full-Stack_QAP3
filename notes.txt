the params going to putFilm are undefined 


not sure if user input for PUT is being processed correctly. it's entering null into the db

Can't get put to work. Maybe take peters week 11 mongo support, get a fresh copy and hook it up to a database with the same fields as his (first_name etc) to see if it even works in his version

check if api routers are independent or if they effect the main route?

see if you can make getbyid match peters, (putting it into an array and then checking the length? Check if its necessary/error codes make sense. if i need to put it in an array i can use cursor to hold the query)

fix camelcase in name from film /actor replace

change refs to norecord to nodocument
